Welcome to my portfolio! I am a passionate Data Analyst with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and strong expertise in Power BI, Python, MySQL, and Machine Learning. I specialize in extracting insights from data, building predictive models, and creating impactful dashboards for better decision-making.

This portfolio highlights key projects that demonstrate my technical and analytical skills:

Flight Delay Prediction (Python):
I developed a machine learning model using Python libraries like scikit-learn and pandas to predict flight delays based on historical flight data. This project focused on feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model evaluation to achieve high predictive accuracy.

Flight Booking Dashboard (Power BI):
I designed a dynamic and interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize booking trends, customer demographics, and operational KPIs for an airline. The dashboard provides real-time insights to support business strategies and improve customer experience.

Flight Data Cleaning Script (Python):
I created a Python script that automates the cleaning of messy flight data. It addresses missing values, duplicate entries, and inconsistent formats to prepare datasets for analysis and machine learning. This ensures data quality and reliability in any data-driven project.

Passenger Database Management System (MySQL):
I built a relational database in MySQL to efficiently manage airline passenger records, booking details, and travel histories. The system supports robust querying, reporting, and data integrity for operational needs.

Skills & Tools:
Languages: Python, SQL

Data Analysis: pandas, numpy

Visualization: Power BI, matplotlib, seaborn

Machine Learning: Regression, Classification, Clustering

Database Management: MySQL

I am deeply committed to continuous learning and delivering data-driven solutions. Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you are interested in collaboration or have any questions!
